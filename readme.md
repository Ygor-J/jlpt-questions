# Goal

The main goal is to create an application that spits random JLPT questions as exercises.


Rules
1. I should be able to select 1 out of 4-5 answers and the app tells me if it's right.
2. If it's wrong, it should tell me why I got it wrong.
3. The questions should appear in random order.
4. If I got a question right, it shouldn't show me it again, at least, not in the same session.

# How to Run API?
